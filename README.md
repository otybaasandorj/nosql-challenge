The UK Food Standards Agency conducts evaluations of food establishments throughout the United Kingdom, assigning each a hygiene rating based on regulatory standards. I have been engaged by the editorial team of the food magazine Eat Safe, Love to analyze a selection of these ratings. The goal of this analysis is to provide insight that will guide the magazineâ€™s journalists and food critics in determining which establishments to highlight in future articles. There were 4 critical questions to explore with the database to provide to the magazine editors. The scores for Hygiene, Structural, and ConfidenceInManagement work in reverse. This means, the higher the value, the worse the establishment is in these areas.

1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?

There were a number of 41 establishments.

2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
   
There were a number of 33 establishments.

3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue rating value of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?
   
There were a number of 55 establishments.
